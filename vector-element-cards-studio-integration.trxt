Vector Element Cards Studio Integration
Overview
This document outlines the process of integrating the vector-based element cards system into the /studio page as a new "Element Card Design" panel, separating it from the PNG-heavy legacy system.
Current State
PNG System: Legacy system with 729+ PNG/JSON files, currently integrated with minting
Vector System: New system at /new-element-cards-system using SVG graphics, currently loading at 0%
Studio: Existing page with various design tools and panels
Integration Strategy
1. Studio Panel Architecture
Storage
2. Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Studio Panel Setup
Create new panel component in /studio
ElementCardDesigner.tsx - Main panel component
VectorCardEditor.tsx - SVG editing interface
SeriesManager.tsx - Manage different card series
Add panel to studio navigation
Integrate with existing studio tab system
Add "Element Cards" tab alongside existing tabs
Phase 2: Vector System Migration
Move existing vector code from /new-element-cards-system
Asset loading logic
Vector rendering components
Filtering and display systems
Adapt for studio environment
Remove standalone page dependencies
Integrate with studio state management
Connect to existing asset context
Phase 3: Series Management
Create series structure
]
Series metadata
Series name and description
Layer definitions
Card properties (rarity, stats, etc.)
Export settings
Phase 4: Vector Editor Integration
SVG editing tools
Basic shapes (rect, circle, path)
Color picker and gradients
Layer management
Export to PNG/SVG
Card template system
Pre-built card layouts
Customizable backgrounds
Stat display templates
Rarity indicators
Phase 5: Preview & Testing
Real-time preview
Live card rendering
Layer combination testing
Stat calculation display
Series testing
Generate sample characters
Test layer compatibility
Validate export formats
Phase 6: Export & Integration
Export to Blob Storage
Convert SVG to PNG for compatibility
Generate metadata JSON
Upload to Vercel Blob
Update asset manifest
Integration with minting
Connect new series to minting system
Update asset loading logic
Test end-to-end workflow
Technical Implementation
File Structure

State Management
Studio Context Extension
Add vector card editing state
Series management state
Export progress tracking
Asset Context Integration
Connect to existing asset loading
Support both PNG and vector assets
Unified asset manifest
Data Flow
Minting
Benefits of This Approach
1. Clear Separation
PNG system remains untouched for current minting
Vector system gets dedicated development space
No conflicts between old and new systems
2. Integrated Workflow
Design cards in studio environment
Test with existing tools
Seamless export to production
3. Iterative Development
Build and test one layer at a time
Get feedback on each series
Gradual migration from PNG to vector
4. Future-Proof Architecture
Easy to add new series
Support for different card types
Scalable asset management
Migration Timeline

Seamless navigation between panels
Consistent UI/UX with existing tools
Vector System Functionality
Create and edit vector cards
Manage card series and layers
Export to production-ready format
Asset Integration
New vector cards appear in minting
Compatible with existing asset system
Proper metadata and organization
Performance
Fast vector rendering
Efficient asset loading
Smooth studio experience
Next Steps
Review and approve this integration plan
Create studio panel structure (Phase 1)
Begin vector system migration (Phase 2)
Iterate and test each phase
Document and refine the process
This approach gives you the best of both worlds: a working PNG system for immediate needs, and a clean development path for the vector system that won't disrupt your current workflow.
Does this integration plan look good to you? This would give you a clean separation between the working PNG system and the new vector development, while keeping everything organized within your existing studio environment.
