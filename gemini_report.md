âœ¦ Report on Vector Card Sizing Issue

  1. Introduction

  This report details the investigation into the sizing issue with the vector cards
  on the /new-element-cards-system/all and /new-element-cards-system pages. The
  vector cards are appearing larger than the PNG images they are intended to frame.

  2. Findings

  The root cause of the sizing issue is a mismatch in aspect ratios between the
  vector card container and the PNG image it displays. This issue originates in the
  src/components/VectorElementCardNew.tsx component, which is used on both of the
  affected pages.

   * Container and Background: The main container div and the SVG background for the
     vector card are styled with a 2:3 aspect ratio. This is evident from the
     hardcoded dimensions in the VectorElementCardNew.tsx component (e.g., w-32 h-48,
     w-48 h-72, w-64 h-96).

   * PNG Image: The PNG image within the card is rendered using the Next.js Image
     component. This component is given a square (1:1) aspect ratio with dimensions
     like 80x80, 120x120, and 160x160.

   * `object-contain`: The object-contain CSS class is applied to the Image component.
      This class scales the image down to fit within its container while preserving
     its aspect ratio. As a result, the square PNG image is contained within the 2:3
     rectangular card, but it does not fill the entire space, creating empty areas and
      making the card appear larger than the image.

  3. Conclusion

  The discrepancy in size between the vector cards and the PNGs is due to the
  conflicting aspect ratios. The 2:3 aspect ratio of the card and the 1:1 aspect
  ratio of the image result in the image not filling the card completely.

  4. Recommendations

  To fix this issue, the aspect ratio of the Image component should be adjusted to
  match the aspect ratio of the card container. This can be achieved by changing
  the width and height props of the Image component to have a 2:3 ratio.

  For example, for the "medium" size card (192x288), the Image component's
  dimensions could be changed from 120x120 to something like 120x180 to match the
  2:3 aspect ratio. This change should be made in the
  src/components/VectorElementCardNew.tsx file.
