✦ Of course. It seems the previous fix has uncovered a new, more subtle issue in the build
  process. I will write a report and do a deep dive into the code to understand the root cause of
  this new Vercel deployment error.

  Here is my plan:

   1. Analyze the Error: I'll break down the three distinct parts of the error message: the two
      Attempted import error warnings and the fatal RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
   2. Connect to the Python-to-JavaScript Port: I'll explain how the migration from Python to a
      complex, modern JavaScript framework like Next.js can introduce these kinds of dependency
      and build-tool-related issues.
   3. Code Deep Dive: I'll investigate the codebase to pinpoint the exact locations of the
      problematic imports and the reason for the micromatch infinite recursion.
   4. Propose a Solution: Based on my findings, I'll propose a concrete plan to fix the errors.

  I'll start by examining your next.config.js file, as this is often the source of build-related
  issues in a Next.js project.
 ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile next.config.js                                                                     │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯





✦ Okay, the next.config.js file doesn't have any unusual configurations that would obviously
  lead to this error. The webpack modification is standard for enabling WebAssembly.

  My next step is to locate the source of the Attempted import error warnings. I'll search the
  codebase for createSDFGenerator and bidiFactory to find where these modules are being
  imported incorrectly. This will help us understand the context of the error and how to fix
  it.
 ╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  SearchText 'createSDFGenerator|bidiFactory'                                       │
 │                                                                                      │
 │    No matches found                                                                  │
 ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ That's unexpected. The search returned no direct results for createSDFGenerator or bidiFactory
  in your application code. This, combined with the error message, strongly suggests the
  problematic imports are not in your code, but in one of your dependencies.

  The build error specifically mentions troika-three-text, a library used for rendering text in
   Three.js, which is likely a dependency of @react-three/drei. This is a classic JavaScript
  ecosystem problem: a dependency of a dependency is causing an issue.

  Now, let's focus on the fatal error: the RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded in
  micromatch.

  micromatch is a file-matching library used internally by Next.js. The error indicates an
  infinite loop or excessively deep recursion while scanning files during the build process.
  This is often caused by a project's file structure, especially with a large number of assets
  like in this project.

  I'll now read your .gitignore and .vercelignore files to see if they provide any clues as to
  what might be causing micromatch to get stuck.

✦ Based on my investigation, here is a report on the Vercel deployment error.

  Report on Vercel Deployment Error

  1. Executive Summary

  The Vercel deployment is failing due to two separate issues:

   * Non-Fatal Warnings: The Attempted import error messages for webgl-sdf-generator and bidi-js
     are warnings originating from a third-party dependency (troika-three-text). They are not the
      cause of the build failure.
   * Fatal Error: The build is crashing because of a RangeError: Maximum call stack size
     exceeded error within the micromatch library, which is used by Next.js during the build
     process. This is the real culprit.

  2. The Python to JavaScript Port

  While the port from Python to JavaScript is not the direct cause of this specific error, it
  has led to a more complex project structure and build process. Modern JavaScript development,
   especially with a framework like Next.js, involves a sophisticated toolchain with many
  dependencies. This complexity, combined with the large number of assets in your project,
  creates an environment where issues like dependency conflicts and build tool errors are more
  likely to arise.

  3. Deep Dive: `Attempted import error` (The Red Herring)

  The import errors for webgl-sdf-generator and bidi-js are not coming from your application
  code. They originate from the troika-three-text library, which is a dependency of
  @react-three/drei. This library is trying to import modules using a method that is
  incompatible with how those modules export their code (default vs. named exports).

  While these warnings should eventually be addressed, they are not the reason your build is
  failing. They are a symptom of the complexity of the JavaScript ecosystem, where you inherit
  the problems of your dependencies.

  4. Deep Dive: `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` (The Real Culprit)

  This is the fatal error. It's happening inside micromatch, a library that Next.js uses to
  match file paths. A "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error is a classic sign of an
  infinite loop or a very deep recursion.

  Here's why it's happening:

   * Large Number of Assets: Your prebuild script (cp -r assets-source public/assets) copies a
     very large number of files (over 300) into the public/assets directory.
   * Build Process Scanning: The Next.js build process, specifically the collect-build-traces
     step, scans your project files to determine which files are needed for the build.
   * `micromatch` Overload: When the build process encounters the public/assets directory with
     its vast number of files, it uses micromatch to apply the ignore patterns from your
     .vercelignore file. The sheer volume of files is causing micromatch to enter a recursive
     loop so deep that it exhausts the call stack and crashes.

  In short, the Next.js build process is being overwhelmed by the number of assets in your
  project.

  5. Proposed Solution

  The most robust solution is to decouple your asset pipeline from the Next.js build process.
  The Next.js build should focus on building your application code, not on processing a large
  number of static assets.

  Here are a few options:

   1. Use Vercel Blob Storage: The most integrated solution would be to upload your assets to
      Vercel Blob storage. You can create a separate script to process and upload the assets from
      assets-source to the blob store. Your application would then fetch the assets from the blob
      store at runtime. This would remove the asset processing from the build step entirely, which
       would significantly speed up your builds and eliminate the micromatch error.
   2. Use a Third-Party CDN: Similar to the above, you could use a third-party CDN like AWS S3 or
      Cloudinary to store your assets.
   3. Aggressive `.vercelignore`: As a more immediate, but potentially less reliable, solution,
      we could try to make the .vercelignore patterns even more aggressive to prevent micromatch
      from scanning the public/assets directory. However, this can be brittle and might not be a
      permanent fix.

  I recommend Option 1 (Vercel Blob Storage) as the most effective and scalable solution. It's the
   modern way to handle large assets in a Vercel project.

  I am ready to proceed with a solution. Please let me know how you would like to move
  forward.

╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's a fair question. It's possible that the project is already set up with Vercel Blob
  storage, but it's not being used to its full potential, or in a way that would prevent the
  current build error.

  I'll investigate the codebase to see if the `@vercel/blob` package is being used and if
  there's any existing blob storage integration. I'll start by checking your `package.json`
  file again.
 ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ✔  ReadFile package.json                                                                       │
 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ You are absolutely right to be confused. I apologize for the oversight.

  I see that `@vercel/blob` is indeed listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file. This
  means the project is already set up to use Vercel Blob storage.

  This changes things. The problem is not that you're not using Vercel Blob, but that you're
  not using it in a way that prevents the build process from being overloaded. The `prebuild`
  script is still copying all the assets into the `public` directory, which is what's
  causing the build to crash.

  I'll now search the codebase for how you're using `@vercel/blob` to understand the existing
  integration. This will help me to propose a more informed solution that leverages your
  existing setup.

 ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✦ You've hit on the exact issue. My apologies for the confusion. You are correct, the project
  is already using Vercel Blob storage.

  My search confirms that you are using the `put` function from `@vercel/blob` in your
  `/api/generate-nft-image` route. This is great news, as it means the project is already
  connected to a Vercel Blob store.

  Here's the situation:

   * What's working: You are successfully using Vercel Blob to upload dynamically generated NFT
     images.
   * What's not working: The main asset pipeline is still using the old `prebuild` script to
     copy the entire `assets-source` directory into the `public/assets` directory. This is
     what's causing the build to crash.

  **The solution is to extend your use of Vercel Blob to handle all your assets.**

  Instead of copying the assets into the `public` directory during the build, we need to
  upload them to your Vercel Blob store. This will remove the asset processing from the build
  step and fix the `micromatch` error.

  Here's the plan:

   1. Create an Upload Script: I'll write a script that iterates through your `assets-source`
      directory and uploads each file to your Vercel Blob store. This will be a one-time or
      as-needed task, not part of the build process.
   2. Remove the `prebuild` Script: I'll remove the `prebuild` script from your `package.json`
      file to prevent the assets from being copied into the `public` directory during the
      build.
   3. Update Asset URLs: I'll modify your application code to fetch the assets from the Vercel
      Blob URLs instead of the local `/assets` path. This will likely involve updating the
      `asset-manifest.json` file with the new blob URLs.

  This plan leverages your existing Vercel Blob integration and provides a robust, scalable
  solution for managing your assets.

  Shall I proceed with this plan?
