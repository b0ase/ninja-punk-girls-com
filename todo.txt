OK I've pushed it. Now.. the filter by # isnt' working, but also, if you take a look at the wallet page, the # is set to 0 for all them (i.e. #0). This is a very long-standing problem which we've been able to fix with multiple attempts and when we try it tends to start throwing jsx errors in the code, even when there are no obvious jsx errors. We've looked deeply into this and haven't foudn out why yet. Despite that I'd like you to take the number generated by a new NFT on the mint page, and pass it to the wallet with the NFT so that teh number shows up next to the name please, and then institute the filter function.
